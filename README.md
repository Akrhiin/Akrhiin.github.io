# Akrhiin.github.io

Still very much a work in progress.  
I'm putting in time where I can as a personal project, with the aim of having a functional blog for myself up and running before I forget and move onto another web scraper or something.

EDIT: I forgot and moved onto another web scraper.  This project is sitting on the back burner till I finish my summer courses.
